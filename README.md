This is the main repository for the website hosted at - [Microsoft Innovation Labs website](https://mlabpesu.azurewebsites.net/). Be sure to head out to our website and take a look at some of the exciting projects carried out at the lab.

# Development
The development version upto date with the current version of master can be found here - [MIL Github pages](https://microsoftmobileinnovationlab.github.io/Mlab_website/).
## Setting up your development environment :

1. Clone the repository after forking with `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mlab_website.git`.
2. Run a HTTP server from within the directory using python3, xampp or any other utility.\
Example: ```python3 -m http.server 8080```
3. Access website from `http://localhost:port` where `port` is the listening port of your http server.

## Contributing

We use a rebase-oriented workflow. We do not use merge commits. This means to get your local branch up-to-date with the upstream, you would use
```
git pull --rebase upstream master
```
instead of regular `git pull`. It’s best to write your commits prefacing the file you changed, but if you don’t, you can always fix your history using `git rebase -i`. An example of a good commit would be
```
index: Fix UI layout in mobile view.
```

## Reviewing other PR's :
Reviewing other PR's is good practice. Easy-to-use scripts in `tools/` have been provided to fetch PR's . Here's how you make use of them :
```
./tools/fetch-pull-request 123
```
(*where `123` is the PR number*).
